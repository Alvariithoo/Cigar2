# Cigar2
**Warning:** Cigar2 is no longer actively developed!  
Protocol 6 Agar.io client for private servers based on Cigar  
Cigar2 is always under development but a new version will never be pushed with known bugs, however there may be unknown bugs but you can report these and they should get fixed as soon as possible. This basically means that the master branch is always stable and is ready-for-use :)
If you want to thank anyone about these new cool features, you should thank Tombez. He did a lot for this repo :)

### Getting support | Discord server
If you need extra help with anything you should ask it in the [Agar.io Private Servers Discord](https://discord.gg/66X2ESb) and not in issues.

### Adding servers
Locate the select element in the index.html then add new entries, WARNING: only put selected in one of them!

### [Recommended server, OgarII by Luka](https://github.com/Luka967/OgarII)

### Based on
- [Original Cigar](https://github.com/CigarProject/Cigar)
- [Luka's Cigar](https://github.com/Luka967/Cigar)

### Uploading skins
Upload them to the skins folder (if you use Nodejs version then it is web/skins).
If you have Nodejs installed, you can run `node updateSkinList.js` in the root directory, otherwise just manually put the skin names in `/web/skinList.txt` separated by commas.
