### Uploading skins
Upload your (**PNG**, **JPEG**, **WEBP**, ...) files to the skins folder and run the updateSkinList file in the root directory, you can also do it manually by putting the skin names in `web/skinList.txt` separated by commas (no file extension).

## **The client is in construction, that means it won't work at all.**
