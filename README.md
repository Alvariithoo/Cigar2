### Adding servers
Locate the select element in the index.html then add new entries, WARNING: only put selected in one of them!

### [Recommended server, OgarII by Luka](https://github.com/Luka967/OgarII)

### Based on
- [Original Cigar](https://github.com/CigarProject/Cigar)
- [Luka's Cigar](https://github.com/Luka967/Cigar)

### Uploading skins
Upload them to the skins folder (if you use Nodejs version then it is web/skins).
If you have Node.js installed (shell & batch script coming soon), you can run `node updateSkinList.js` in the root directory, otherwise just manually put the skin names in `/web/skinList.txt` separated by commas.
